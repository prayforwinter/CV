  <!-- What other attributes can we add? -->

  <p>
    It was almost an accident, how it all began. Alexander had humble
    beginnings at a bookstore for six years before venturing out into the
    world of QA. He was contacted by a QA consulting firm and the rest is
    history (tomorrow is a mystery...) He is now studying to be a developer.
    He was born in Chicago, Illinois but never wants to see that place ever
    again. He currently resides in <strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>.
    Please make a note of that.
